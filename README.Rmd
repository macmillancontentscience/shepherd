The goal of shepherd is to make it as easy as possible to deploy an R script as an AWS Lambda function, and otherwise manage your Lambda functions using R.


## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("macmillancontentscience/shepherd")
```

## Examples

Coming soon. 

The first thing we plan to implement is a function to upload an existing Dockerfile to an S3 bucket, build the image using CodeBuild and deploy that image on ECR, and then create a Lambda function from that image.
